# Alert Acknowledgement

● Alert acknowledgement is used to confirm that a system alert has been seen and is being handled. Whenever the system detects an issue such as server downtime, high resource usage, or network failure, it generates an alert. The responsible user acknowledges the alert to indicate that action has been taken.
This helps avoid confusion and prevents multiple users from working on the same problem. It also improves incident handling by tracking which alerts are active and which are already under process.
Example: If a server goes down, the admin acknowledges the alert and starts fixing the issue while others know it is already being handled.

## Send Notifications

Send notifications allows the system to inform users about alerts and important system events in real time. Notifications ensure that users are aware of problems even when they are not actively monitoring the system.
The system can send notifications through email, SMS, or in-app messages. This helps users respond quickly and reduce downtime.
Example: When disk space becomes critically low, the system sends a notification to the administrator so that corrective action can be taken.

## View Monitoring Dashboard

The monitoring dashboard provides a visual overview of the system’s current status and performance. It shows important details such as CPU usage, memory usage, network activity, and active alerts.
By using the dashboard, users can easily identify abnormal behavior and take preventive action before serious issues occur.
Example: An admin notices a sudden increase in CPU usage on the dashboard and investigates the cause before the system slows down.

## Log Events and Alerts

Log events and alerts is used to keep a record of all important system activities and alerts. Every event such as alert generation, acknowledgement, errors, and user actions is stored with time and details.
These logs are helpful for debugging problems, auditing system activity, and analyzing failures after they occur.
Example: After a system crash, logs are checked to understand what went wrong and how to prevent it in the future.
