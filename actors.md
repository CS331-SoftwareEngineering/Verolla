## System Actors 

### Admin
The administrator manages and controls the entire system.  
They configure monitoring thresholds, manage users, view detailed system metrics, and handle alert policies and system settings.

### Normal Users
Normal users can view system health information and receive alerts.  
They monitor dashboards, check alerts, and view logs based on the permissions granted by the admin.

### Monitoring Agents
Monitoring agents are background components installed on systems or servers.  
They continuously collect performance metrics such as CPU usage, memory usage, disk usage, and application status.

### Artificial Intelligence Models
AI models analyze collected metrics and historical data.  
They help detect anomalies, predict potential failures, and reduce false alerts.

### Notification Services
Notification services deliver alerts to users and admins.  
They send notifications through channels such as email or messaging platforms.
